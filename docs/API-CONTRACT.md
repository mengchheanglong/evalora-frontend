# Evalora API Contract

Base URL in local development:

```text
http://localhost:4000/api
```

Frontend code should read the backend URL from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and default to the local base URL.

## Response conventions

- JSON only for MVP.
- Authenticated endpoints return `401` for missing/invalid token.
- Role-restricted endpoints return `403` for valid user without permission.
- Validation errors return `400` with a clear message.
- AI/sandbox errors should return a safe fallback message and preserve progress.
